This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain Android devices.  The camera preview fails to render, resulting in a blank screen.  This issue is intermittent and does not consistently occur across all devices or builds. The error messages are not consistent, sometimes showing nothing in the console. The code works correctly on iOS and most Android devices.  Here is a code snippet illustrating the issue:

```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

const App = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = useState(Camera.Constants.Type.back);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; 
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type}>
        {/* Camera preview will not show here on some devices*/}
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
};
```
